The st.file_uploader function in Streamlit allows users to upload PDF files, enabling them to interactively select and upload their PDF documents for further processing or analysis within the Streamlit Web Application. In this code snippet, embeddings are created using the OpenAIEmbeddings() function, which likely generates embeddings (vector representations) for the text data extracted from the PDF file.
