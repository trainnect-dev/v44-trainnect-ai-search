        "content": "Written by Ecohz\nPublished on 01 January 2025\nLike every year, we are looking ahead to identify key trends for the next 12 months. From emerging conversations in the renewables industry to policy changes that will significantly impact clean energy development, here are five topics that corporate buyers of renewable energy should keep an eye on in 2025.\n1 Location and time matching vs. cross-border emissionality [...] Renewable energy remains a reason for optimism. According to projections by the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewable electricity will overtake coal-generated electricity for the first time in 2025, accounting for 35% of global electricity supply. Solar PV, which keeps getting cheaper, “is expected to meet roughly half of the growth in global electricity demand over 2024 and 2025.” [...] On one side, some advocate for stricter geographic boundaries in market-based renewable procurement, coupled with closer alignment between renewable energy production and consumption times. This approach, they argue, could drive investment in regions that need greater renewable energy deployment, particularly in countries that currently import most of their Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs).",

Power and renewables: a year of accelerating innovation\nLengthy permitting and interconnection processes have been two of the biggest bottlenecks to faster renewables growth in power systems globally. There are signs that the penny has dropped, and that 2025 could be the start of a new era for renewables. Germany has demonstrated the impact permitting reform can make: Since implementing reforms in 2022, awarded permits for onshore wind have increased 150%. [...] What are the opportunities, challenges and risks for the energy and natural resources sectors in 2025? Here are five key trends.\n1. Brave new world\nThe new Trump administration is out to make a mark in global trade, climate policy and geopolitics, all with potentially profound implications for energy and natural resources. [...] 2. Capital allocation and finance\nInvestment in the supply of energy and natural resources will reach record levels in 2025, with spend exceeding $1.5 trillion over our forecasts, up 6% in real terms on 2024. The forecast is for capital investment across power and renewables (excluding wires), upstream oil and gas and metals and mining.",
