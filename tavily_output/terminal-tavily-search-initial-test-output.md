Todays date is March 17, 2025.  1.  In December 2024 Anthropic published an article titled "Building effective agents" and I want you to tell me all of the key points of the article as well as provide me with 5 - 10 links to sources that mention the article in this current year of 2025.  2.  Also Tell me which LLM you are as I am conducting research on LLM model responses,

Agents, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks. When more complexity is warranted, workflows offer predictability and consistency for well-defined tasks, whereas agents are the better option when flexibility and model-driven decision-making are needed at scale. Building blocks, workflows, and agents The basic building block of agentic systems is an LLM enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory. When to use this workflow: Routing works well for complex tasks where there are distinct categories that are better handled separately, and where classification can be handled accurately, either by an LLM or a more traditional classification model/algorithm.',
