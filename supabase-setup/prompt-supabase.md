 So we have made progress but still have some issues.  
 
 1.  What happens now When I click New chat it takes me to a New weird looking page!!!! and another window with text at the bottom Why???.  This new Chat page and window is not part of my apps architecture nor should it be!!! This is terrible and the users hate it and are asking why this was implemented??? 
 
 2. First Understand that our app essentially has three independent standalone apps with features and the ability to use tools. What should happen we I click New Chat + icon.   New Chat + icon must work independently for each of the standalone apps. 
 
 3. The AI-Chat feature is a standalone app that has the ability to use tools. When the user clicks on AI-Chat icon text they are using the AI-Chat feataure and if the user clicks on the New Chat + icon while they are using the AI-Chat feataure the user should be presented with a new AI-Chat session not taken to an entirely new page outside of the AI-Chat page and AI-Chat page session.    
 
 4.  The AI-Search feature is a standalone app that has the ability to use tools. When the user clicks on AI-Search icon text they are using the AI-Search feataure and if the user clicks on the New Chat + icon while they are using the AI-Search feataure the user should be presented with a new AI-Search session not taken to an entirely new page outside of the AI-Search page and AI-Search page session.   

 5. The AI-Agent feature is a standalone app that has the ability to use tools. When the user clicks on AI-Agent icon text they are using the AI-Agent feataure and if the user clicks on the New Chat + icon while they are using the AI-Agent feataure the user should be presented with a new AI-Agent session not taken to an entirely new page outside of the AI Agent page and AI-Agent page session.  
 
 
 6. Lastly the New Chat text is larger, to large, than the other text in the sidebar, fix this.

The UI looks great and and all of the features works well however, the Supabase authentication flow and database operations are not working correctly. 

Follow these steps to ensure that the Supabase authentication flow and database operations are functioning correctly:

## Step 1: Verify Environment Variables - COMPLETED
Verify Environment Variables in .env.local file in the root of your project 

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

## Step 2: Implement Authentication Flow
Create a login component that uses Supabase's authentication methods. Use the following code as a reference:

import { supabase } from '@/utils/supabase/client';

const handleLogin = async (email, password) => {
  const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({ email, password });
  if (error) {
    console.error('Login error:', error);
    // Handle error (e.g., show a message to the user)
  } else {
    console.log('User logged in:', user);
    // Redirect to the main application page
  }
};

Ensure that the login component is rendered when the user is not authenticated. Use supabase.auth.getUser() to check the user's authentication status.

## Step 3: Verify Database Schema

Check the Supabase dashboard to confirm that the chat_sessions and chat_messages tables exist.

Verify the schema of both tables matches the following:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS chat_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Untitled Chat',
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS chat_messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  session_id UUID REFERENCES chat_sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('user', 'assistant')),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

## Step 4: Ensure RLS Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled
Ensure RLS is enabled for both tables. Use the following SQL commands:

ALTER TABLE chat_sessions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE chat_messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

Ensure RLS policies to allow users to access their own data. Use the policies defined in your schema.sql file.

## Step 5: Test Database Operations
Create a function to insert a new chat session. Use the following code:

const createChatSession = async (title) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('chat_sessions')
    .insert([{ title, user_id: supabase.auth.user().id }]);
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error creating chat session:', error);
  } else {
    console.log('Chat session created:', data);
  }
};

Call this function after a successful login to create a new chat session.

## Step 6: Fetch Chat Sessions
Implement a function to retrieve chat sessions for the authenticated user:

const fetchChatSessions = async () => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('chat_sessions')
    .select('*')
    .eq('user_id', supabase.auth.user().id);
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching chat sessions:', error);
  } else {
    console.log('Chat sessions:', data);
  }
};

Call this function after the user logs in to display their chat sessions.

## Step 7: Debugging and Verification
Log errors during authentication and database operations to the console for debugging.

Use the browser's developer tools to inspect network requests to Supabase. Check for any failed requests and their responses.

Test the application by logging in, creating a chat session, and retrieving chat sessions to ensure everything is working as expected.
